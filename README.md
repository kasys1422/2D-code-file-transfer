# 2D Code File Transfer

2D Code File Transfer is a simple web application that allows you to transfer files between two devices using 2D codes. The sender's device encodes the file into multiple 2D codes that are displayed sequentially, and the receiver's device scans the codes using the camera and decodes the file.

## Features

* File transfer using 2D codes
* Works on both desktop and mobile devices
* Progress bar and statistics display for the receiver
* Bootstrap-based user interface
* More than 80% of the programs, including this README, were created using GPT-4.

## Usage

1.  Open the [site](https://kasys1422.github.io/2D-code-file-transfer/) in a modern web browser on both the sender and receiver devices.
2.  On the sender's device, click the "Choose File" button and select the file you want to transfer.
3.  On the receiver's device, click the "Start Camera" button and allow camera access.
4.  The sender's device will display a series of 2D codes. Point the receiver's camera at the codes, making sure to scan them all in order.
5.  The receiver's device will display the progress of the transfer. Once completed, a "Download File" button will appear. Click it to download the transferred file.

## Limitations

* The file transfer speed depends on the scanning capabilities of the receiver's device.
* Large files might require a significant amount of time to transfer.
* The 2D codes must be scanned in order for the file transfer to be successful. Make sure the receiver's device scans each code correctly.
